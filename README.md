# Extraction & analysis of data in CSV files

The mission of this project was to create summary reports from very large data sets (over a million lines) in CSV files, and then print those reports to text files. 

Using a Python script, the project required opening the csv file, extracting data, making the necesary analysis, and then exporting the formatted summary report to a text file.
